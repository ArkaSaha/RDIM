# Robust and Dynamic IM
This repository contains the code and data used in the experiments of the AAAI 2025 paper titled _"Hyperparametric Robust and Dynamic Influence Maximization"_ by Arkaprava Saha, Bogdan Cautis, Xiaokui Xiao and Laks V.S. Lakshmanan.

## Data
Our real-world dataset `Weibo` is contained in the folder `weibodata`. Every synthetic dataset is contained in a folder of the form `data_n0`, where `n0` is the initial number of nodes before any network update. The synthetic datasets can be generated by the following command:
```bash
python generate.py n m d
````
Each dataset is represented by a folder containing two files: 
1. `graph.txt` with `m0` lines of the form `u v`, each denoting an edge
2. `features.txt` with `n0` lines of the form `v	f1 f2 ...`, where `fi` denotes feature `i` of node `v`.

## Code Usage
Our method and the three baselines (LUGreedy, BASE and HIRO) can be run together using the following command:
```bash
python compare.py path-to-dataset k d B l T mode
```
Here the parameter `mode` can take one of the values `half` and `full`, referring to the incremental setting and the fully dynamic setting respectively. Running the above command generates two files `comp_score.txt` and `comp_time.txt` comparing the solution qualities and running times respectively. Each of these files contains several lines, each corresponding to a network update and containing four space-separated values denoting the corresponding metric for our method, LUGreedy, BASE and HIRO, in that order.
